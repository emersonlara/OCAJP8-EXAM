## Things to Keep in Mind:
#### Primative Data Types:
  - Sizes of whole numbers:
    - `byte` = 8 bits = -128 to 127 ... suffix: none
    - `short` = 16 bits ... suffix: none
    - `int` = 32 bits = -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 ... suffix: none
    - `long` = 64 bits ... suffix: `L` or `l` (ex 10_000_000_000L is fine)
    - NOTE: a `char` is also 16 bits.
  - Sizes of decimals:
    - float = 32 bits ... suffix `f` or `F`
    - double = 64 bits = approx Â±1.79769313486231570E+308 ... suffix `d` or `D`
  - Note that `Char` can store integers, ex. `int i = 5` or `char c = '5'` are valid (but different numbers)
* Default Initialization:
  - byte: 0, short: 0, int: 0, long: 0L, float: 0.0f, double: 0.0, boolean: false, char: \u0000 
  - When printed on the console: byte, short, int & long prints 0, float & double print 0.0
* Object versions of primatives:
  - All the wrapper objects are immutable. So, `obj++` means `obj = new Integer( obj.intValue()  + 1);`
  - Wrapper classes do NOT have no-args constructors
  - `Integer()` and `Double()` are siblings (both extends from Number class) so they can NOT be casted to each other
  - When declaring `Boolean()`, the values are not case-sensitive ... `Boolean("TrUE")` is OK
  - For the `Boolean()`, passing in `Boolean("true")` (or any case-insenstive "tRUE") gives `true`, otherwise you get `false`, so `Boolean("Ham Sandwich")` is `false`
  - The default values in this arr are null, not false `Boolean[] arr = new Boolean[1];` (they are object references)
  - Define new `Integer()` as `1` or `"1"`
  - `Integer() == Integer()` is NOT same as `Integer().equals()` ... same rules as Strings, use `.equals` to compare by value and `==` to check if it's the same object
  - BUT WAIT... Don't forget that weird work issue where if the int is < 127, then `new Integer(127) == new Integer(127)` (same for > -128) ... but then `new Integer(128) != new Integer(128)`
  - `Double()` can take in a number like `10.0` or `10` or a String like `"10"` or even a char (since that can be converted to `int` value... ex. `'a'` = `97`)
* Review rules on casting between different numbers
  - `float` can NOT be assigned to `int` without explicit casting
  - `double` can NOT be assigned to `int` without explicit casting
  - `double` can NOT be assigned to `float` without explicit casting
  - `int` can NOT be assigned to `byte` without explicit casting (unless, of course, u write it like this `byte b = 127` AND the number is small enough to be a byte... ex `byte b = 300` is NOT ok, this give compilation error)
  - `int` can NOT be assigned to `short` without explicit casting (unless, of course, u write it like  `short s = 32767` )
* Decimal v. Binary v. Octal v. Hexa
  - These can be `int` or `long` values
  - Binary start with `0b`. Example, `0b1010` is 10 decimal value (1x2^3 + 0x2^2 + 1x2^1 + ...)
  - Octal starts with `0`. Example, `012` is 10 decimal value (1x8^1 + 2x8^0)
  - Hexadecimal starts with `0x`. Example, `0xa` is 10 decimal value (highest letter is F/f, can be CAPS or lowercase)
* Error vs. Infinity
  - Float division will give +/- Infinity (only if you divide by `0.0`)
  - Int division will give `ArithmeticException`  (i.e. if you divide by `0`)


#### Flow Control:
- Don't forget about Short circuiting of `&&` and `||` ... the `&` and `|` do NOT short circuit
- Always double check `switch` case values... Trick questions like  `int score = 60;switch (score); case score < 70:`. This is NOT ok b/c score is `int` but score < 70 is  `boolean`
- The `switch` condition can NOT be `boolean`, `long`, or `double` or `float`
- The `switch` condition CAN be `String`, `char`, `int`, `short`, `byte`, the respective wrapper classes, or `enum` 
- The `switch` requires a constant condition (ex. `case args[0]` is not ok since it can change)
- The `break` statement breaks out of the closest LOOP/SWITCH (or ANY labeled STATEMENT within the scope)
- The `continue` statement basically jumps to the bottom of the LOOP, starting with the next iteration (or continues to labeled LOOP)


#### Strings:
- `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` is used to extract the substring. The substring begins at "beginIndex" and extends to "endIndex - 1". 
- `substring(int beginIndex)` is from the start position all the way to the last position
- Yes, the `.toString` method works the same in `String` and `Stringbuilder` (shows the string, not the class@hashcode)
- StringBuilder class does NOT override `equals(Object)` method!!!
- Don't forget that Strings are immutable... common issue: `str1.trim();` will not change str1, need to do `str1 = str1.trim();`
- StringBuilder and String are both `final` classes


#### Arrays:
- Yes, arrays DO extend from `Object` ... BUT `int[]` and other primitive arrays do NOT extend `Object[]`
- Both are valid: `int[] myArr` or `int myArr[]` for an int array
- Warning: This is NOT valid... `double[] arr = new int[2];` ... `int[]` and `double[]` are NOT analagous to `int` and `double`
- outermost array length is `arr.length`, then get inner arrays with `arr[x].length`
- It IS ok to have a trailing comma in an array declaration: `int[] arr = {1,2,3,};` is valid!!!
- Expression `int arr[], i` gives 1 array of ints and 1 int.
- Use `.sort()` method on an array instance to sort by values (ex. `intArray.sort()` sorts ASC, i.e. 1,2,5,7,..)


#### ArrayLists / Iterator:
-  If you want to remove the items from an ArrayList, while using Iterator or ListIterator, then use `Iterator.remove()` or method and NOT `ArrayList.remove()` method
- The method for `.addAll(1, list2);` inserts all values in list2 at index 1... doesn't delete anything... just slides over values.
- `List` is an interface so its instance can't be created using new keyword.
- Arraylist has `.remove(Object o)` (removes the first occurrence of obj) or `.remove(int i)` (removes by position)
- Using `.remove( new CustomObject("blah") )` may not remove anything if the `.equals()` methods are not overridden, since hashcode of new object won't match those in the list
- `.remove(Object obj)` method returns `boolean` result but `.remove(int index)` returns the removed item from the list (ex an int or String)
- Note that the `.set(int pos, Object obj)` returns the value of whatever was replaced (its likely NOT a boolean)
- The `.subList(x,y)` works like the `.subString(x,y)`, the y is exclusive (i.e. range is x to y-1)
- Yes, the `.add()` returns a boolean value if the list is altered
- Modifying the arrayList within enhanced loop (i.e. `:`) will give `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`


#### OOP:
- Methods are called based on the instance, ex. `A o1 = new C(); o1.method();` will call the method on the C class
- Fields are called based on the class type, ex. `A o1 = new C(); o1.field;` will access the field on the A class
- a Subtype can't refer to an object of Supertype, i.e. `(SubType) SuperTypeInstance()`; will throw ClassCastException.
- Possible to have abstract class without any abstract method
- Java compiler adds `super();` as the first statement inside a constructor if  acall to another constructor using this(...) or super(...) is not available.
- Using `.clone()` makes a shallow copy, objects contained in an ArrayList are not copied (just their references), primative are copied
- Yes, you can put access modifiers in front of constructors (yes, even `private` )
- TO call another constructor from within a constructor, you MUST use `this()`, you can NOT explicitly call `ObjectConstructorName()`!!!
- Automatic boxing of 10.0 can occur in `add(Double d1, Double d2)` for `add(10.0, new Double())`
- Yes, you CAN call on `super.methodName()` within child object
- Class declared as `final` can't be inherited. Examples are: String, Integer, System etc. Ex class `MyString extends String` is not OK since String is final
- Without `class Vehicle extends Car`, we will get a compilation error for `Vehicle obj = new Car();` ... and not an expection like classCastExpection
- A constructor should have `super()` or `this()`  but not both
- Same as interfaces, inherited methods / fields cannot have their accessibility narrowed.



#### Interfaces:
- Yes interfaces do extend from `Object` class
- Any field in an interface is `public`, `static`, and `final`, whether these keywords are specified or not.
- All methods and fields in an interface must be `public`.
- A method in an interface can be either `abstract`, `default`, or `static`.
- Note that `static` methods belong to the interface class and can NOT be overridden
- An `default` method cannot be `abstract` or `static` since it has no definition and must be defined outside the interface
- A `default` method provides a default implementation, which can be overridden by a class that implements the interface
- An `abstract` method has no implemenation (ex. `void doSomething();`)
- Yes, interfaces can have `static` methods. BUT they cannot be inherited. This means that they can only be called using the full qualified name (ex. `MyInterface.myStaticMethod()` and NOT called from the object that implements it
- You can NOT narrow accesibility of interface methods, by default `void yo();` is public in an interface, therefore in the class implementation, it must be `public`


#### Methods/Fields
- Be careful not to confuse Override with Overload!!!
- Only 1 Variable Arity (`vararg...`) is allowed per parameter list, and it must be the LAST parameter in the method.
- Vararg `...` must be attached to type, not the variable name. Ex `String... args` is OK and `String args...` is not.
- Methods must have different signatures (i.e. input types) to be overloaded, the same inputs and a different output are not OK.
- Parameters in a method CAN be `final`, just don't change their value within the method call
- If no args are given, the `main()` methods gets an array of size 0 (and not `null`)
- To `@Override` a method, the parameters must be the same and in the same order, AND the return type must be the same (or a subtype of the original, i.e. covariant)


#### Memeber Accessibilty Modifiers
- `private` - can only be accessed within the declared class itself. They are NOT inheritied by the subclass.
- `package-private` (i.e. nothing written) - available to any other class in the same package. Is NOT available to another class outside the package, not even if it the other class extends the class with the `package-private` field.
- `protected` - can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package or any class within the package of the protected members' class.
- `public` - can be accessed from any other classes (assuming their packages are imported).


#### Memeber Non-Accessibilty Modifiers
These specify certain aspects that are not related to accessibity.
- `static` fields only exist for the class for which they are defined, but they can be called by an instance of the class
- `static` methods only exist for the class and can only be called by the class (i.e NOT by an object)
- `final` fields cannot have their value change. For primitives, they are a constant. For reference values, the object itself can change but the reference to that object cannot change.
- `final` methods cannot be overridden by a subclass
- `abstract` methods do not have an implementation. The subclass must implement the method. They look like: `abstract myMethod();`. They can NOT be static or final.
- `sychronized` methods mean that only 1 thread can execute that at a time.
- `native` methods are those whose implementation is NOT in Java.


#### Exceptions:
- All errors and exceptions are derived from the `Throwable` CLASS!
- Check exceptions are those which are not Error or RunTimeException (or their subclasses)
- Anything that explicitly `throws` an Exception requires a try / catch block
- The `try` block is only enough if the class it's inside of also `throws` the same checked exception (or its superclass), otherwise we, must have a `catch` for the specific checked exception
- There is no `ArrayIndexException`, that is FAKE... The correct one is `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
- Exceptions in `catch` blocks need to be handled in order... ex. `catch(FileNotFoundException){}` needs to come before `catch(IOException){}` since it extends the IOExpection
- All the `catch(){}` must come before the `finally{}`
- Something like `catch(FileNotFoundException | IOException e)` is NOT ok if the 2 exceptions are sub / superclasses (as is the case in this example)
- If a super class / interface method `throws` a checked exception, then the overriding method of sub class can NOT declare to throw the super class of the exception thrown by super class / interface 
- Yes, `main()` methods is allowed to `throws Exception` (or any other expection, ex. IOException)
- The `IOException` must be imported from `java.io.*;`


#### Garbage Collector:
  - You can NOT "force" the JVM to run the Garbage Collector
  - But can "request" it to MAYBE get called using either: `System.gc();` or `Runtime.getRuntime().gc();`


#### Lamdba Functions
- If using blocks (i.e. `{}`) then must have a `return` statement.
- Method to call on predicate function is `.test()`
- Be careful with `Predicate` vs `Predicate<String>` (or other types), the generic `Predicate` will assume type is `Object` so methods like `.length()` or `.size()` may not be useable


#### Time/Date:
- Do NOT forget that LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime are immutable!
  - Using `date.plusDays(-1);` will NOT alter the `date`. You need to do `date = date.plusDays(-1);`
- Do NOT forget that these are also STATIC FACTORIES, and not object instances. must use `.of()` or `.parse()`
- Always, always, always make sure you're not cross contaminating TIME stuff with LocalDate and DATE stuff with LocalTime
- The `.of()` must have a valid date or time, otherwise it gets an expection... Ex `LocalDate.of(2020, 2, 30)` will fail but if we had `add()` that got to that point, it would round down.
- Using `date.atTime(LocalTime)` method creates a LocalDateTime instance by combining date + time parts
- The `Period.of(0, 0, 0);` is same as `Period.ZERO`, it shows up as `P0D` (and NOT `P0Y0M0D`)
- Using `.parse()`, must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format ... the `YYYY-M-DD` will not work
- LocalDate objects cannot use `==` to compare values, need to use `.equals()`
- Yes, `minusYears()` (and other times) can add/subtract negative values (i.e. `minusYears(-40)` is OK)
- Long chain of B.S. like this? `Period period = Period.of(2, 1, 0).ofMonths(5).ofDays(2);` ... only LAST thing (`ofDays()`) is valid since `Period` is a static method... Not to be confused with taking the 1st call
- Same as other objects, don't forget that `LocalDate != LocalDate`, use `.equals()` to compare by value
- Always be careful using right months (`LocalDate`) vs. minutes (`LocalTime`)
- Break down of the `.ofPattern("MM-DD-yy")` (capitialized = bigger letter = bigger number)
  - `MM` is MONTH
  - `mm` is minute
  - `DD` is DAY OF YEAR, 2 digit max (ex. Feb 3 is 34th day of year)
  - `DDD` is DAY OF YEAR, 3 digit max (ex. Dec 31th is 365th day (or 366th if leap year))
  - `dd` is day of month
  - `yy` is year (2 digit) and `yyyy` is year (4 digit). Note that `uu` and `uuuu` also work.
- Methods like `getMonth()` (singular) relate to LocalDate or LocalDateTime and `getMonths()` (plural) is for a `Period`
- Printing the `LocalDate` will be in format `yyyy-MM-dd`
- The LocalTime has `LocalTime.of(int hour, int minute, int second, int nanoOfSecond)` as most params and `LocalTime.of(int hour, int minute)` as least params
- The LocalTime prints as `23:01:15` or `HH:mm:ss` format
- Note that `11:01:15 pm` is `.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("HH:mm:ss a")` or `("hh:mm:ss a")` pattern
- Use `"hh:mm:ss.SSS"` for milliseconds (max of 9 S's)


#### Misc:
- A `static {}` block fires off before `public static void main(String[] args){}`
- As long as the others are not directly accessible by JVM, you can have more than 1 `main()` method (i.e. can't have 2+ public `main()` methods in 2 `public` classes)
- You can run a `public static void main()` method from a public or package-private class.
- Don't get tricked by methods that look like constructors... always check for `void` or other return type, then its method
- Package within a Package cannot access package-private field .. ex. if `com.test` has a package-private field then `com.test.A` cannot access it
- Yes, you can edit static fields using an object instance (but its not good practice)
- Note that `.length()` is NOT valid for arrays lengths, use `.length` for Arrays
- Note that `.length` is NOT valid for String lengths, use `.length()` for Strings
- Use `.size()` (and NOT `.length()`) for ArrayLists 
- Variable names cannot start with a number, ex. `48chevy` is not allowed... But you CAN start with `$` or `_`
- Only underscore and currecny symbols are allowed in variable names, other special character like `@` are not allowed
- Comments within comments may not work... Examlple, `/* /* */ */` is NOT valid... The second `*/` is not matched up b/c the second `/*` is commented out.
- Be sure to use `import static` for static fields, ex. `import static java.lang.Math.PI;`
- For classpatch (`-cp`), you can use the `:` as a seperator, ex. `.:pkg` means `.` or `pkg` directories
- Enhanced for loop (`:`) cannot iterate over a Map (Map does not implement `Iterable` interface)
- Don't forget that the compiler has an "Unreachable Code" check.
- To override the `.equals()` method, it must take have obj parameter `equals(Object obj)` not `equals(SomethingElse obj)`
- You can NOT use keywords (ex. for, break, int) as labels!
