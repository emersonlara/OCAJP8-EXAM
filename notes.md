## Things to Review:
* Primative Data Types:
  - Sizes of whole numbers:
...byte = 8 bits
...short = 16 bits
...int = 32 bits = -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
...long = 64 bits

  - Sizes of decimals:
...float = 32 bits
...double = 64 bits = approx Â±1.79769313486231570E+308 

* Strings
...`substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` is used to extract the substring. The substring begins at "beginIndex" and extends to "endIndex - 1".
